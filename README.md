# PythonTools

A collection of Python-based tools I find useful.  Will update periodically.

In data.py, is a class of file I/O via .txt extension.
It takes Python(3.6) dictionaries as targets to read and write data.
Dictionaries must be in standard format provided.

In text.py, is a class of text output, via iteration.
It is based on print(), so it's only useful in terminal applications.
